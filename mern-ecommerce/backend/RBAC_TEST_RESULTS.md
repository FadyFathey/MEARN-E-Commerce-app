# RBAC Implementation Test Results

## ✅ Implementation Summary

The Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system has been successfully implemented and tested. Here are the results:

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates

- ✅ Updated `User` model: Replaced `isAdmin` boolean with `role` enum (`'user'`, `'admin'`)
- ✅ Updated `SanitizeUser` utility: Now includes `role` in JWT token payload

### 2. Middleware Implementation

- ✅ `verifyToken`: Existing middleware works correctly with new role field
- ✅ `verifyAdmin`: New middleware checks for admin role and returns 403 if unauthorized

### 3. Route Protection

- ✅ **Product Routes**:

  - `POST /products` - Admin only ✅
  - `PATCH /products/:id` - Admin only ✅
  - `DELETE /products/:id` - Admin only ✅
  - `PATCH /products/undelete/:id` - Admin only ✅
  - `GET /products` - Public access ✅
  - `GET /products/:id` - Public access ✅

- ✅ **Order Routes**:

  - `GET /orders` - Admin only ✅
  - `POST /orders` - Authenticated users ✅
  - `GET /orders/user/:id` - Authenticated users ✅
  - `PATCH /orders/:id` - Authenticated users ✅

- ✅ **User Routes**:
  - `DELETE /users/:id` - Admin only ✅
  - `GET /users/:id` - Authenticated users ✅
  - `PATCH /users/:id` - Authenticated users ✅

### 4. Additional Features

- ✅ Migration script: Automatically converts existing `isAdmin` to `role`
- ✅ Admin user creation: Added test admin user in seed data
- ✅ Self-protection: Admins cannot delete their own accounts
- ✅ Utility functions: `isAdmin()` and `isUser()` helper functions

## 🧪 Test Results

### Admin User Tests

- ✅ **Login**: Admin can login successfully
- ✅ **Role Verification**: JWT token contains correct role (`"role":"admin"`)
- ✅ **Product Creation**: Admin can access product creation endpoint
- ✅ **Order Access**: Admin can view all orders
- ✅ **User Management**: Admin can delete other users

### Regular User Tests

- ✅ **Login**: Regular user can login successfully
- ✅ **Role Verification**: JWT token contains correct role (`"role":"user"`)
- ✅ **Product Creation**: User correctly blocked (403 Forbidden)
- ✅ **Order Access**: User correctly blocked from viewing all orders (403 Forbidden)
- ✅ **User Management**: User correctly blocked from deleting users (403 Forbidden)

### Security Tests

- ✅ **Unauthenticated Access**: Proper 401 responses for missing tokens
- ✅ **Invalid Tokens**: Proper 401 responses for invalid tokens
- ✅ **Insufficient Privileges**: Proper 403 responses for non-admin users
- ✅ **Self-Protection**: Admins cannot delete their own accounts

## 📊 API Response Examples

### Successful Admin Login

```json
{
  "_id": "68893a8da762195527a255de",
  "email": "admin@gmail.com",
  "isVerified": true,
  "role": "admin"
}
```

### Successful User Login

```json
{
  "_id": "68893a8da762195527a255e0",
  "email": "demo@gmail.com",
  "isVerified": true,
  "role": "user"
}
```

### Access Denied Response

```json
{
  "message": "Access denied. Admin privileges required."
}
```

## 🔐 Security Features Implemented

1. **Role-Based Authorization**: All admin operations require admin role
2. **Token-Based Authentication**: JWT tokens include role information
3. **Middleware Chain**: Authentication → Authorization → Controller
4. **Self-Protection**: Admins cannot delete their own accounts
5. **Proper Error Responses**: 401 for auth issues, 403 for authorization issues

## 🎯 Protected Endpoints Summary

| Endpoint                 | Method | Access Level | Status       |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| `/products`              | POST   | Admin Only   | ✅ Protected |
| `/products/:id`          | PATCH  | Admin Only   | ✅ Protected |
| `/products/:id`          | DELETE | Admin Only   | ✅ Protected |
| `/products/undelete/:id` | PATCH  | Admin Only   | ✅ Protected |
| `/orders`                | GET    | Admin Only   | ✅ Protected |
| `/users/:id`             | DELETE | Admin Only   | ✅ Protected |

## 🚀 Ready for Production

The RBAC implementation is complete and tested. The system now properly enforces role-based access control with:

- ✅ Secure authentication
- ✅ Proper authorization
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ✅ Comprehensive protection of admin endpoints
- ✅ Backward compatibility through migration
- ✅ Self-protection mechanisms

## 📝 Usage Instructions

### For Developers

1. Use `verifyToken` middleware for authentication
2. Use `verifyAdmin` middleware for admin-only endpoints
3. Use `isAdmin()` utility function in controllers for conditional logic

### For Testing

- Admin credentials: `admin@gmail.com` / `password123`
- User credentials: `demo@gmail.com` / `password123`

The RBAC system is now fully functional and ready for production use! 🎉
